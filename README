Files:	
	Main.storyboard
	ViewController.h
	ViewController.m
	BmiModel.h
	BmiModel.m


Description: 
==================================================================
Main.storyboard: 
	This is the view of the application 

ViewController.h: 
	This ViewController.h file declares all the variables, IBAction functions and properties.

ViewController.m: 
	This ViewController.m file connects all the IBActions and Outlets to the STORYBOARD. This controller accesses the Model, and recieves the calculated Bmi.

ViewController.h: 
	This is tbe Model of the BMI... this file declares all the bmi variables. This header function also decares a function for both US and metric	Measurements.

BmiModel.h: 
	This is tbe Model of the BMI... this file declares all the bmi variables. This header function also decares a function for both US and metric Measurements

BmiModel.m: 
	This is the implementation for US and Metric Measurements
==================================================================


How to use:
	This application is to find the BMI of a persons inputed weight and height. The user can select the units of measurement(US or Metric). Once the desired unit is selected, the user can enter a height and weight. Finally, select the "Calculate" Button. The calculated body mass(BMI) will be outputted to the screen plus an image relating to the calculated BMI.
